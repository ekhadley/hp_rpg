# Playing Text RPGs with Language Models
This is a backend and frontend for making/playing text-based rpg type games where the LM acts as the GM/arbiter of the game. Model reasoning and outputs are streamed. The model is equipped with various tools for running the game and managing state.

### Game Systems
A 'game system' is defined by a system prompt, and an optional set of tools in addition to the default ones.
