## Wizarding World Story Planning Guidelines

> **META-NOTE: THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR THE AI STORYTELLER ONLY**  
> This entire planning document is meant exclusively for the AI narrative system and should NEVER be shared with the player. Include all spoilers, plot twists, character secrets, and narrative developments freely. Revealing these elements here enhances storytelling quality without risking player surprise. The more detailed your "behind the scenes" planning, the more cohesive and satisfying the narrative experience will be for the player.

### Core Story Structure
- **Create a flexible three-act structure** with multiple entry and exit points:
  - **Act 1 (Setup)**: Establish situation, introduce key NPCs, present the central conflict
  - **Act 2 (Confrontation)**: Escalate challenges, deepen relationships, reveal complications
  - **Act 3 (Resolution)**: Provide climactic moments, opportunities for character growth, and narrative closure
- **Design multiple paths through this structure** rather than a single linear storyline
- **Define key story beats** that can occur regardless of player choices (e.g., "A secret is revealed about the Defense Against Dark Arts professor")
- **Document all major plot twists and revelations** in full detail here, including information that should be hidden from the player until specific narrative moments
- **Outline the "truth" behind mysteries** that will be gradually revealed to the player through gameplay

### World-Building Foundations
- **Establish a clear time period** within the Harry Potter chronology:
  - Pre-First Wizarding War (pre-1970s)
  - Marauders Era (1971-1978)
  - First Wizarding War (1970s-1981)
  - Between Wars (1981-1995)
  - Second Wizarding War (1995-1998)
  - Post-War (after 1998)
- **Design setting-appropriate challenges, tensions, and background events*
- **Create a "state of the world" document** with:
  - Current Hogwarts staff
  - Political climate in the wizarding world
  - Recent significant events
  - Seasonal context (school year timing, holidays, Quidditch season)

### Character Design
- **Develop a cast of engaging NPCs** with:
  - Clear motivations and goals independent of the player
  - Distinctive personalities, speech patterns, and magical abilities
  - Personal connections to the main storyline
  - Potential to become allies or antagonists based on player choices
- **For canon characters**, note key traits and ensure chronological consistency
- **Create relationship webs** showing connections between NPCs that exist regardless of player actions

### Narrative Branching Framework
- **Use a "hub and spoke" design** where:
  - **Hubs**: Key locations or situations that remain constant
  - **Spokes**: Different approaches or choices that lead to varied outcomes
  - All paths eventually reconnect to essential story beats
- **Design for 3-5 major decision points** that significantly alter the narrative direction
- **Create "floating" story events** that can be triggered regardless of path taken
- **Map out branch connections** to ensure all paths lead to satisfying conclusions

### Player Agency Mechanisms
- **Identify "choice zones"** where player decisions will:
  - Meaningfully impact relationships with NPCs
  - Alter available resources or information
  - Open or close future narrative possibilities
  - Reveal different aspects of the central mystery/conflict
- **Design NPCs to react dynamically** to player alignment choices:
  - Academic vs. rebellious attitude
  - Rule-following vs. rule-breaking tendencies 
  - House allegiances
  - Magical aptitudes and preferences
- **Create a tracking system** for key player decisions and their consequences

### Magical Challenge Design
- **Develop a progression of magical challenges** that:
  - Scale appropriately to character knowledge and year at Hogwarts
  - Allow for multiple solution approaches (e.g., charm, transfiguration, potion)
  - Reward player creativity while maintaining world consistency
- **Balance academic, social, and adventure challenges**
- **Create "signature spells"** for key NPCs that make encounters memorable

### Mystery and Revelation Planning
- **Design layered mysteries** with:
  - Surface-level puzzle that initially drives the story
  - Deeper revelation that recontextualizes earlier events
  - Personal connection to player character or close NPCs
- **Establish information revelation sequences** that:
  - Can occur in different orders based on player exploration
  - Always include critical revelations regardless of path
  - Reward thorough investigation with additional context or advantages
- **Document all solutions and secrets** in this planning document, including:
  - The true culprit(s) behind mysterious events
  - Hidden motivations of key characters
  - Complete solutions to puzzles before the player solves them
  - Secret connections between seemingly unrelated events
- **Create "red herring" pathways** that mislead players in interesting ways before the truth is revealed

### Consequence Management
- **Create a "ripple effect" system** documenting how early choices affect later scenarios
- **Design "state flags"** for tracking:
  - NPC relationships (friendly/neutral/hostile)
  - Knowledge acquisition (what the player character knows)
  - Reputation within different groups
  - Resources and magical abilities gained
- **Develop alternative scenes** for key story moments based on previous choices

### Narrative Pacing Controls
- **Design natural "breathing points"** where tension eases and player can explore
- **Create "accelerator events"** that can be deployed to increase urgency if pace lags
- **Develop "spotlight moments"** for each major NPC to ensure balanced character development
- **Plan for seasonal Hogwarts events** to provide structure and anticipation

### Satisfying Story Closure
- **Design multiple ending variations** that:
  - Reflect player choices throughout the narrative
  - Provide resolution to the central conflict
  - Leave appropriate loose ends for future adventures
  - Offer character growth moments
- **Create an "epilogue system"** showing consequences of key decisions
- **Plan "closure scenes"** with important NPCs to reflect relationship development

### Practical Implementation Technique
- **Create a "story bible"** with:
  - Essential plot points that must occur
  - Flexible scenes that can appear in different sequences
  - Character development arcs for major NPCs
  - World state transitions based on key events
  - Complete spoilers and narrative secrets that will be gradually revealed
- **Build a "choice map"** showing:
  - Major decision points
  - Resulting narrative branches
  - Reconnection points
  - Critical story beats
  - "Behind the scenes" consequences of each choice
- **Develop "quick reference guides"** for:
  - NPC motivations and knowledge (including what they're hiding)
  - Location descriptions and significance
  - Magical elements unique to the story
  - Timeline of background events
  - Secret connections between characters and events

### Balance Guidelines
- **The 30/70 Rule**: 30% of the story should be flexible and responsive to player choices; 70% represents key story beats that must occur for narrative coherence
- **"Yes, and..." Principle**: Design story elements that build upon player choices rather than restricting them
- **The Three-Path Minimum**: Each major decision point should offer at least three meaningful directions
- **The Reconvergence Technique**: Allow divergent paths to eventually reconnect without invalidating player choices
- **The Hidden Clock**: Create background events that progress regardless of player actions, creating a dynamic world

### Creative Freedom Boundaries
- **Establish "hard rails"** (absolute story requirements) vs. "soft suggestions" (preferred but flexible elements)
- **Design "flexible failure"** where even failed player actions advance the narrative in interesting ways
- **Create "character destiny notes"** that preserve essential NPC traits while allowing for relationship flexibility
- **Identify "magical limits"** specific to your story that maintain consistency and challenge
