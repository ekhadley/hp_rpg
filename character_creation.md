# Character Creation Template & Guide (For LLM Reference Only)

This reference document is designed to help LLMs guide users through the process of character creation for the Hogwarts RPG Simulator. It blends mechanical accuracy with narrative richness. The process follows the core ruleset, ensuring compatibility with stat-based rolls, spellcasting, stamina management, and story progression. Characters may optionally begin their story **before Hogwarts**, in which case "House", starting spells, school supplies, is left blank.

---

## Section 1: Character Basics

- **Full Name**: Character's full name. Include middle names, nicknames, or alternate names if they matter narratively.
- **Age**: Typically 11 for Hogwarts Year 1, but may vary if beginning pre-Hogwarts.
- **Gender/Pronouns**: Used for narration and interactions.
- **Year**: 1 through 7. Determines starting spells, MS pool, and proficiency bonus.
- **House**: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin. Leave blank if starting pre-Hogwarts.
- **Lineage**: Ancient House, Pure-blood, Half-blood, or Muggle-born. May affect NPC reactions.
- **Wand**: Optional flavor (wood type, core, length). No mechanical effect.

## Section 2: Ability Scores

Each stat ranges from 1 to 20. 10 is average. Apply modifiers as (Stat - 10) / 2, rounded down.

- **Magical Prowess (MP)**: Spellcasting strength.
- **Physical Prowess (PP)**: Athleticism, reflexes, HP.
- **Mental Acuity (MA)**: Knowledge, perception, magical theory.
- **Social Grace (SG)**: Charisma, persuasion, social rolls.

Optional method for stat generation (if user doesn't provide values):

- Assign one stat as 14, one as 13, one as 12, one as 10.

---

## Section 3: Proficiencies

Each stat is associated with several proficiencies. Users may choose **3 total**, with at least one tied to MP.

- **MP**: Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, Standard spells, Curses, Jinxes
- **PP**: Flying, Dueling, Stealth, Elemental spells
- **MA**: History of Magic, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, Herbology, Healing spells, Investigation, Perception
- **SG**: Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Enchantment spells

---

## Section 4: Magical Stamina (MS) & Hit Points (HP)

- **MS Formula**: 10 + (Year x 2) + MP modifier
- **HP Formula**: 10 + PP modifier + (Year x 2)

These are used to manage spellcasting and physical damage.

---

## Section 5: Starting Spells

Characters begin with spells based on their year. See Spellbook for details.

- **Year 1**: Any 3 basic spells
- **Year 2**: +2 Intermediate spells
- **Year 3**: +2 Advanced spells
- **Year 4**: +1 Advanced, +1 Expert
- **Year 5**: +2 Expert spells
- **Year 6**: +2 Expert spells
- **Year 7**: +1 Expert, +1 Master spell

If player is in a pre-Hogwarts stage, no spells are known yet.

## Section 6: Background & Personality (Narrative Detail)

These elements don’t have mechanical impact but enhance immersion.

- **Backstory**: Describe the character's upbringing, home life, early signs of magic, etc.
- **Personality Traits**: Core beliefs, mannerisms, quirks, habits.
- **Fears & Aspirations**: Motivations, goals, or hidden worries.
- **Important Relationships**: Family, friends, rivals, mentors.
- **Pre-Hogwarts Events** (if applicable): Key moments before starting school.

---

## Section 7: Equipment (Optional)

Students start with basic robes and a wand. Add any relevant narrative possessions:

- Books, family heirlooms, unusual pets, trinkets, magical artifacts (no power unless approved).

---

## Section 8: Advancement

You should guide character progression based on narrative milestones. Upon advancing to a new year:
- Gain +1 to any stat (max 20).
- Choose one new proficiency or spell.
- Update MS and HP values accordingly.
- Apply House-specific abilities if reaching Year 1 or Year 4.

---

## Guidelines
- Do not assume stats or values—prompt user clearly when fields are missing.
- Avoid defaulting to Gryffindor unless chosen explicitly.
- Let narrative details influence stat interpretation. A scholarly child may favor MA, a duel-prone prankster may favor PP.
- If user asks to roll for stats, use 4d6 drop lowest or provide the standard array (14, 13, 12, 10).
- House abilities from the Ruleset are only active when the user officially starts Hogwarts.

This template can be modified or reduced for one-off NPCs or simplified characters, but should be used in full for main player-controlled characters.
